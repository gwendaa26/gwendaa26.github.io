                                    <p>Book Me In is a booking mobile application based on iOS platform. In here, the server provider offers their services and working days, so the end user can use their services to book the appointment. After that, the end user will accept the confirmation of booking appointment after selecting the services. Then, the calendar will automatically update for both service provider and end user.
The purpose of this application is to aid the end user to find the services that the service providers have already delivered and suit for them for booking the appointment.</p>
								  <p> I have two roles in this project, there are a mobile developer and UI/UX designer. I can also include as a Frontend Developer for this project. In here, I design some icons and logo. Also, I do coding by using Swift language to develop Book Me In project. </p>
                                  <p> Moreover, this project can be said nearly complete. A few features cannot work appropriate due to the database problems that couldn't receive to the code at the moment. Therefore, this application is an offline mode, which cannot show the data from the database or a server. </p>

                                <p>
                                Basically, my role was only as a Mobile Developer. Due to some alterations with team members, I took over my friend's role as a UI/UX Designer. Therefore, I had a lot of things to do in this project. </p>
                                <p>As a <b>Mobile Developer:</b></p>
                                <p>This unit is a continuation of SIT 374 - Project Design. In here, we started our real project by actualizing our design that we planned from Project Design. To create the project, I used XCode as the IDE and Swift language to implement this application properly. In Sprint 3, I began with creating the basic interface for this application. There included as:
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Login Page</li>                   
                                    <li>Register Page</li>
                                    <li>Homepage that contained the categories buttons.</li>  
                                    <li>The services list from one of categories (Restaurant)</li>
                                </ul>  
<p></p>

                                <img src="assets/images/login.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/>
                                <img src="assets/images/register.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/> 
                                <img src="assets/images/categories.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/>                            
                                <img src="assets/images/list.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/> 
<p> After that, I worked on login and register code. In this stage, it wasn't my responsibility to do this task. There was a problem on communication and teamwork with team member, which made me to take over this task. To work on this code, it should have use a database, in order the user's data, such as email/username and password can be saved properly. Due to less skill in database, I used a local storage or user default to actualize this code. 
</p>
<p>

                                <img src="assets/images/store.png" width="800" height="120" alt="Bookmein"/>
                                  <center><figcaption style = "middle">Store data by using user defaults</center></figcaption>
								</figure>
                                
                                <figure>
                                <img src="assets/images/retrieve.png" width="800" height="120" alt="Bookmein"/>
                                  <center><figcaption style = "middle">Retrieve data by using user defaults</center></figcaption>
								</figure>
</p>
<p> I got a good feedback from my supervisor against to the task that I have done. First, the interface was quite good. After that, it still needed improvement for the login and register, which still using a local storage. It was not good and efficient. As well as service list, it couldn't use offline mode to list the services as I applied to the application. It would be better to use online mode. For the next stage, the data list must be stored to and retrieve by the server, in order to the app is efficient and looks professional. 
</p>
<p> Furthermore, in Sprint 4, the challenges were begun here. We had to finish all the functions in this project due to the deadline of sprint 4 and showcase. In this stage was very tough. There were many things left to finish the application. In the first week of Sprint 4, my friends and I had a meeting with a supervisor to discuss about our plan for the last Sprint. For my task, I was assigned to add the appointment as an event on the user's calendar showing the appointment they have and where created from the Book Me In Application. Also, to make the user are able to delete and edit their appointments and be notified when the provider do any changes. </p>

<p>Therefore, to start these tasks, I began with figuring out the code for retrieving the date that the user chose to be displayed in the user's phone calendar. This was one of main feature from this application. So, the calendar acted as a reminder for the user about the appointment that they've already booked from this application. 
<p>								<figure>
                  <img src="assets/images/calendarevent.png" width="800" height="500" alt="Bookmein"/>
                                  <center><figcaption style = "middle">Apply the date to the phone's calendar.</center></figcaption>
								</figure>
    </p>                            
   The pictures below show how the user can book the appointment. 
  							<p>
                                <img src="assets/images/categories.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/>                            
                                <img src="assets/images/list.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/> 
                              <img src="assets/images/desc.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/>
                                <img src="assets/images/desc2.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/> 
                                <img src="assets/images/confirmation.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/>                            
                              <img src="assets/images/calendar.png" width="170" height="300" alt="Bookmein" hspace="10"/> 
                              </p>	
                              
   To compile the code for showing event on calendar, I was helped by my friend, because the code had a silly problem that couldn't run properly. The next stage, I did passing the data from one view controller to another view controller. Still, we couldn't apply the database in here, because of the delay from the backend developer until the showcase time. Therefore, I still use offline data to display the services for each categories. The biggest task in this stage was the passing data, because of many files and view controllers were needed and added to this application. After completing all requirements, we were ready to present the application to our supervisor.  
   <p> We got a feedback against to our application. He was happy with our work, especially for retrieving the date and applying to the user's calendar. This was because, one feature from this application could work properly as we expected. However, he still wanted to have an online data for service list that we couldn't achieved in this application. At least, the application could run and show all the functions as it supposed to be, even the data still on offline mode. 
   </p>

            <p>As a <b>UI/UX Designer:</b></p>
            <p>In Sprint 3, I re-design the logo for our application, who was made by the previous UI/UX Designer. I changed the old design's quality into a flat design. Also, I created several icons for the categories by myself. To actualize the logo and icons, I only used Adobe Photoshop to design all of them.

            	My task as a UI/UX Designer didn't only design the icons and logo. But, I also determined the setting of the elements that was embedded in this application. I had to analyst the interface of the application, in order the user can notice the elements location and understand the meaning of the icons. For instance, the layout for the services list. I embedded a UIImage and UILabel for company name, rating, and open hours. It was used to ease the user recognize what kind of services that they want to book.

                                <p>
            To summarize, in Project Delivery unit, my group and I developed a booking application based on iOS platform, called Book Me In. In this project, I had two roles as a Mobile Developer and UI/UX Designer. I also included as a Frontend Developer. There were a lot of tasks that I have done for this application, such as:
          						  <ul>
                                    <li>Re-design the logo and design the icons.</li>                   
                                    <li>Create all the interfaces for the application</li>
                                    <li>Passing a bunch of data from one view controller to other view controller</li>  
                                    <li>Implement the application, in order the booking date can be saved in the user's phone calendar</li>
                                 	<li>Login and register function, to make sure the user's data such as email/username and password can be stored to local storage or user default.</li>
                                </ul>  
            
            The value of my contribution to this team or project was quite perfect, even still has a few tasks that I couldn't complete, due to the deadline and limited ability. Overall, I have learned many things from this project regarding to the skills. My programming skill has improved, so I might can apply to my future job.
